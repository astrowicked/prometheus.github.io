          <p><em>This is the first in a series of interviews with users of Prometheus, allowing
them to share their experiences of evaluating and using Prometheus. Our first
interview is with Daniel from Life360.</em></p>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-life360-does?">Can you tell us about yourself and what Life360 does?<a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-life360-does" name="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-life360-does"></a>
</h2>

<p>I’m Daniel Ben Yosef, a.k.a, dby, and I’m an Infrastructure Engineer for
<a href="https://www.life360.com/">Life360</a>, and before that, I’ve held systems
engineering roles for the past 9 years.</p>

<p>Life360 creates technology that helps families stay connected, we’re the Family
Network app for families. We’re quite busy handling these families - at peak
we serve 700k requests per minute for 70 million registered families.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.life360.com/"><img src="/assets/blog/2016-03-23/life360_horizontal_logo_gradient_rgb-cbd96375a03.png" style="width: 444px; height:177px"></a></p>

<p>We manage around 20 services in production, mostly handling location requests
from mobile clients (Android, iOS, and Windows Phone), spanning over 150+
instances at peak. Redundancy and high-availability are our goals and we strive
to maintain 100% uptime whenever possible because families trust us to be
available.</p>

<p>We hold user data in both our MySQL multi-master cluster and in our 12-node
Cassandra ring which holds around 4TB of data at any given time. We have
services written in Go, Python, PHP, as well as plans to introduce Java to our
stack. We use Consul for service discovery, and of course our Prometheus setup
is integrated with it.</p>

        <aside>Posted at: March 3, 2016 by Fabian Reinartz</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by Prometheus servers and sends
notifications about them to different receivers based on their labels.</p>

<p>A receiver can be one of many different integrations such as PagerDuty, Slack,
email, or a custom integration via the generic webhook interface (for example <a href="https://github.com/fabxc/jiralerts">JIRA</a>).</p>

<h2 id="templates">Templates<a class="header-anchor" href="#templates" name="templates"></a>
</h2>

<p>The messages sent to receivers are constructed via templates.
Alertmanager comes with default templates but also allows defining custom
ones.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will walk through a simple customization of Slack
notifications.</p>

<p>We use this simple Alertmanager configuartion that sends all alerts to Slack:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">global:
  slack_api_url: '&lt;slack_webhook_url&gt;'

route:
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
  # All alerts in a notification have the same value for these labels.
  group_by: [alertname, datacenter, app]

receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
</code></pre>

<p>By default, a Slack message sent by Alertmanager looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-03-03/slack_alert_before-cb14b42b46d.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It shows us that there is one firing alert, followed by the label values of
the alert grouping (alertname, datacenter, app) and further label values the
alerts have in common (critical).</p>

<p>A year ago today, we officially announced Prometheus to the wider world. This
is a great opportunity for us to look back and share some of the wonderful
things that have happened to the project since then. But first, let's start at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Although we had already started Prometheus as an open-source project on GitHub in
2012, we didn't make noise about it at first. We wanted to give the project
time to mature and be able to experiment without friction. Prometheus was
gradually introduced for production monitoring at
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> in 2013 and then saw more and more
usage within the company, as well as some early adoption by our friends at
Docker and Boexever in 2014. Over the years, Prometheus was growing more and
more mature and although it was already solving people's monitoring problems,
it was still unknown to the wider public.</p>

        <aside>Posted at: August 17, 2015 by Fabian Reinartz</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>In a <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/advanced-service-discovery/">previous post</a> we
introduced numerous new ways of doing service discovery in Prometheus.
Since then a lot has happened. We improved the internal implementation and
received fantastic contributions from our community, adding support for
service discovery with Kubernetes and Marathon. They will become available
with the release of version 0.16.</p>

<p>We also touched on the topic of <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/advanced-service-discovery/#custom-service-discovery">custom service discovery</a>.</p>

<p>Not every type of service discovery is generic enough to be directly included
in Prometheus. Chances are your organisation has a proprietary
system in place and you just have to make it work with Prometheus.
This does not mean that you cannot enjoy the benefits of automatically
discovering new monitoring targets.</p>

<p>In this post we will implement a small utility program that connects a custom
service discovery approach based on <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">etcd</a>, the
highly consistent distributed key-value store, to Prometheus.</p>

        <article class="doc-content">
          <p><em>Editor's note: This article is a guest post written by a Prometheus user.</em></p>

<p><strong>If you are operating the network for 10,000's of demanding gamers, you need to
really know what is going on inside your network. Oh, and everything needs to be
built from scratch in just five days.</strong></p>

<p>If you have never heard about <a href="http://www.dreamhack.se/">DreamHack</a> before, here
is the pitch: Bring 20,000 people together and have the majority of them bring
their own computer.  Mix in professional gaming (eSports), programming contests,
and live music concerts. The result is the world's largest festival dedicated
solely to everything digital.</p>

<p>To make such an event possible, there needs to be a lot of infrastructure in
place. Ordinary infrastructures of this size take months to build, but the crew
at DreamHack builds everything from scratch in just five days. This of course
includes stuff like configuring network switches, but also building the
electricity distribution, setting up stores for food and drinks, and even
building the actual tables.</p>

<p>The team that builds and operates everything related to the network is
officially called the Network team, but we usually refer to ourselves as <em>tech</em>
or <em>dhtech</em>. This post is going to focus on the work of dhtech and how we used
Prometheus during DreamHack Summer 2015 to try to kick our monitoring up another
notch.</p>

          <p>In his <em><a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2015/05/01/openlettertomonitoringproducts/">Open Letter To Monitoring/Metrics/Alerting Companies</a></em>,
John Allspaw asserts that attempting "to detect anomalies perfectly, at the right time, is not possible".</p>

<p>I have seen several attempts by talented engineers to build systems to
automatically detect and diagnose problems based on time series data. While it
is certainly possible to get a demonstration working, the data always turned
out to be too noisy to make this approach work for anything but the simplest of
real-world systems.</p>

<p>All hope is not lost though. There are many common anomalies which you can
detect and handle with custom-built rules. The Prometheus <a href="../../../../../docs/querying/basics/">query
language</a> gives you the tools to discover
these anomalies while avoiding false positives.</p>

        <aside>Posted at: June 1, 2015 by Fabian Reinartz, Julius Volz</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>This week we released Prometheus v0.14.0 — a version with many long-awaited additions
and improvements.</p>

<p>On the user side, Prometheus now supports new service discovery mechanisms. In
addition to DNS-SRV records, it now supports <a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a>
out of the box, and a file-based interface allows you to connect your own
discovery mechanisms. Over time, we plan to add other common service discovery
mechanisms to Prometheus.</p>

<p>Aside from many smaller fixes and improvements, you can now also reload your configuration during
runtime by sending a <code>SIGHUP</code> to the Prometheus process. For a full list of changes, check the
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0140--2015-06-01">changelog for this release</a>.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the built-in service discovery mechanisms and provide
some practical examples. As an additional resource, see
<a href="/docs/operating/configuration">Prometheus's configuration documentation</a>.</p>
